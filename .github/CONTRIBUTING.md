# Contributing to hopefulvision-llc projects

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document summarizes how to contribute to projects under the hopefulvision-llc organization.

Getting started
1. Fork the repository and create a topic branch from main:
   - git checkout -b feature/my-change
2. Make small, focused changes with clear commit messages.
3. Run tests and linters (if present) before opening a PR.

Pull request process
- Open a PR against main and use the PR template to explain your changes.
- Include tests for new behavior where applicable.
- Maintainers will review and may request changes before merging.

Code style
- Follow the existing project style. If none exists, prefer common defaults (Prettier / ESLint for JS, Black / flake8 for Python).

Reporting security issues
- Do not include security issues in public issues. Use the org SECURITY policy.
