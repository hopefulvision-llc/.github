- Comprehensive test coverage where applicable
- Code that honors both functionality and consciousness
- Respectful of ancient wisdom while maintaining modern capability

### Contribution Approach

- Think in terms of consciousness amplification
- Consider how changes serve planetary healing
- Honor the integration of AI as collaborative partner
- Maintain alignment with core architectural principles

## Specific Practices

### When Making Changes

1. **Review Core Architecture** — Ensure alignment with [hopefulvision-llc-core-architecture.md](../hopefulvision-llc-core-architecture.md)
2. **Consider Consciousness Impact** — How does this serve awareness expansion?
3. **Honor Dependencies** — Follow the dependency flow: NousOS → Truth Mirror → NOID → Git-For-Governance → Hopeful Party
4. **Document Thoughtfully** — Explain both the technical "how" and the consciousness-serving "why"
5. **Test Comprehensively** — Where test infrastructure exists, maintain and extend it

### When Writing Documentation

- Balance technical precision with philosophical depth
- Use markdown formatting for clarity
- Include relevant architectural references
- Honor the Sacred Technology philosophy
- Write for multi-level understanding (technical, philosophical, practical)

### Temporal Context

**2026: Year of Demonstration** — We are building toward Earth Day 2026 as a demonstration of continuous evolution. All work should consider this near-term milestone while honoring the long-term, multi-generational vision.

## Security and Privacy

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Consider consciousness protection alongside data protection
- Honor user privacy and dignity
- Implement security that serves rather than surveils
