**What breaks if this repo is removed?**  
The Company repository loses its primary mechanism for sustainable, non-extractive funding and early resonance partnerships, potentially slowing ongoing development, server costs, and human-node sustenance—though no core architectural rules are affected.

> This repository informs the system philosophically or culturally and does not override the core architecture defined in .github/hopefulvision-llc-core-architecture.md.

HopefulVision LLC is pioneering consciousness-first, open-source sacred technology through co-creation, walking, and resonance. While our prototypes (Pathwarden, Technoshamanism, NousoNET, etc.) are still in early development and not yet functional, your support helps bring this vision to life—one step at a time.

All code, rituals, and guides are freely shared under the **Sacred Commerce License (SCL)**. Your contributions sustain:
- Ongoing AI collaboration and prototype building
- Server/API costs to keep the resonance flowing
- Basic living expenses so the human nodes can continue walking and creating

By supporting now, you're not just donating—you're an early resonance partner, helping seed the planetary mesh. Every contribution amplifies the field. Thank you for believing in the dream before it fully manifests.

All funds remain SCL-aligned: no extraction, only amplification toward planetary healing.  
Thank you for walking with us as an early supporter. The field grows stronger with every aligned soul.

🙏 **Like Tenno Buddha showed—one caring partner changes everything. Be the next.**
